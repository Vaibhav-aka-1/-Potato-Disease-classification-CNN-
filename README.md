It typically includes a series of steps that involve processing and analyzing
textual data in order to determine whether the news is fake or real.
1. Data Collection: Gathering textual dataset from kaggle using pandas.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by removing irrelevant
information, such as stop words, punctuation marks, sentence
tokenization, stemming and lemmatization. Using Spacy, NLTK and
Gensim.
3. Feature Extraction: After preprocessing, text representation is carried
out using following methods.
Bag_of_words(count vectorization), Bag of n_gram, Tf-idf, Word
Embedding using Word2Vec, Glove or BERT using libraries like (sklearn,
spacy, Gensim, Fasttext, tensor hub)
4. Model Selection, Model Training and Model Evaluation: Using sklearn,
Tensorflow/keras
